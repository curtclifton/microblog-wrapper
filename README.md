# Micro.blog Wrapper

*An experimental wrapper framework for posting to and editing [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) hosted microblogs.*

The intent is to eventually include Mac and iOS clients for the framework.

The framework is not intended to provide timeline reading, but just to provide for posting, browser an individual user's posts, and deleting posts. If the micro.blog API is extended to allow editing of posts, then that would be in scope for this framework as well.
